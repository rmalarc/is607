##Summary

This is a warm up exercise to help you to get more familiar with the HTML, XML, and JSON file formats, and using packages to read these data formats for downstream use in R data frames. In the next two class weeks, weâ€™ll be loading these file formats from the web, using web scraping and web APIs.

I selected three of my favorite books along with the following attributes:

* Title
* Authors
* Publishe Date
* Hardcover Price
* Kindle Price

The data was saved in three different formats:

* HTML
* JSON
* XML

## Getting JSON Data in R
```{r}
require("rjson")
json_data <- "http://webonastick.com/uscl/feeds/uscl.json.txt"
books_json <- fromJSON(file=json_data)
```

## Getting XML Data in R
```{r}
require(XML)
xml_data <- xmlParse("http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=29.803&lon=-82.411&FcstType=digitalDWML")

books_xml <- xmlToList(xml_data)
```
