## Some Facts

* The words “group project” fill my heart with a deep sadness.
* One person always ends up doing all the work.
* One person always tries to take charge and steer things in a strange new direction.
* One person cares way too much and it’s frightening.
* At least one person doesn’t care AT ALL.
* There’s always a passive aggressive email chain from hell.
* Trying to schedule a time to meet is a nightmare.
* Group projects make me want to cause mental or physical harm to all the other group members.

## Pitfals

* Poor and disparate communication
* Lack of visibility of what others are doing
* Limited time availability
* Disparate skills

## The Strategy

* Break up work into small chunks that can be carried out independently (Agile style)
* Recognize team's needs:
    * Working with code collaboratively
    * Project management
    * Educational objectives of assignment
* Rely on collaboration tools for: 
    * Sharing Data: **PSQL Server**
    * Code Management: **Github**
    * Project management and communication: **Trello**
* Yes, if it was just you, the work would get done in much less

## The Goal

Week 1:

* Have a collaboration baseline in place
* Have a "development environment" that consists of:
    * A github repo where everyone can commit code
    * Database server housing data source and model
    * Basic scripts/API that illustrates how to connect to data source
    * Tidied up data source

## The Goal

Week 2:

* Complete submission sections:
    * Data source
    * Descriptive statistics
    * Data visualization
    * Data modeling
* Prepare for presentation
* Polish submission
