## Some Facts

* The words “group project” fill my heart with a deep sadness.
* One person always ends up doing all the work.
* One person always tries to take charge and steer things in a strange new direction.
* One person cares way too much and it’s frightening.
* At least one person doesn’t care AT ALL.
* There’s always a passive aggressive email chain from hell.
* Trying to schedule a time to meet is a nightmare.
* Group projects make me want to cause mental or physical harm to all the other group members.
